    <p class = "machines">One of the things I'm interested in is machinery.  I find older machines such as typewriters very interesting and I think that it allows me to think more about how they work. I also have an old typewriter that I got from a garage sale that is pretty cool!</p>
    <img src="\Images\laptop.jpg" alt="laptop" class="game">
    <p class = "videogames">Another thing that I enjoy is video games.  Not only do I enjoy them because they are fun to play, but I also like them because of the possibilities that they might have. I sometimes try to find certain modifications to the games that I enjoy in order to make them more interesting.</p>
