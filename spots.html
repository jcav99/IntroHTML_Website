        <img src="\Images\centralpark.jpg" alt="Central Park">
        <p class="park">One of my favorite places to go to in NYC is Central Park.  I'm a big fan of this place because since it is so large you can do a lot of stuff in it, and I live very close to it. It's a very pretty place to visit, and there is nowhere else in New York City like it.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="\Images\bridge.jpg" alt="Brooklyn Bridge">
        <p>Another place that I like to visit is the Brooklyn Bridge.  The place already looks massive, but it looks even bigger when you walk through it in person.  Its an amazing way to see and travel around the city.</p>
